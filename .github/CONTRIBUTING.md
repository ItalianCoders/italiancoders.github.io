# Contributing
Thanks for your interest in contributing to the ItalianCoders Website! :tada:

## Contributing Etiquette
Please see the [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bfmatei/stencil-boilerplate/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for information on the rules of conduct.

## Creating an Issue
* It is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Although I would love to help the users as much as possible, diagnosing issues without clear reproduction steps is extremely time-consuming and simply not sustainable.
* Issues with no clear steps to reproduce will not be triaged. If an issue is labeled with "needs reply" and receives no further replies from the author of the issue for more than 5 days, it will be closed.
* If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already been [reported](https://github.com/ItalianCoders/italiancoders.github.io/issues). You can search through existing issues to see if there is a similar one reported. Include closed issues as it may have been closed with a solution.
* Next, [create a new issue](https://github.com/ItalianCoders/italiancoders.github.io/issues/new) that thoroughly explains the problem. Please fill out the populated issue form before submitting the issue.

## Creating a Pull Request
* I appreciate you taking the time to contribute! Before submitting a pull request, I ask that you please [create an issue](#creating-an-issue) that explains the bug or feature request and let me know that you plan on creating a pull request for it. If an issue already exists, please comment on that issue letting me know you would like to submit a pull request for it. This helps me to keep track of the pull request and make sure there isn't duplicated effort.
* Looking for an issue to fix? Make sure to look through the open issues with the help wanted label!
* Note very well that **pull requests must not contain more than 10 commits, must not involve more than 10 files and every commit must not change more than 3 files and not more than 50 lines of code**... if this does seem obvious and stupid, it may not be for someone else.
